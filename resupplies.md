#Resupplies#
I am using [UPS Priority Mail Regional Rate Box B2](https://store.usps.com/store/browse/uspsProductDetailMultiSkuDropDown.jsp?productId=P_RRB_B2) for each of the following resupply shipments as recommended by my brother [JohnZ](http://johnzahorian.com/). It is a flat rate regardless of the weight for up to 20lbs.

Note: you will need to pack approx 7 days (~28,000 calories<sup>1</sup>) of food before your first resupply.
