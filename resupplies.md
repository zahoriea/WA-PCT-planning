#Resupplies#
I am using [UPS Priority Mail Regional Rate Box B2](https://store.usps.com/store/browse/uspsProductDetailMultiSkuDropDown.jsp?productId=P_RRB_B2) for each of the following resupply shipments as recommended by my brother [JohnZ](http://johnzahorian.com/). It is a flat rate regardless of the weight for up to 20lbs.

You will hike 148.4 miles from the start of Section H until your first resupply at White Pass.

**Important:** All calories listed are my own approximations based off of my height, weight, and daily mileage. I'm estimating about 4,000 calories per day, but yours will vary.

###1. White Pass###
There is a small ski area 1/2 mile SW of the PCT on Hwy 12 with a motel and Kracker Barrel convenience store where you will ship your resupply box. There are 97.6 miles until the next resupply. At a pace of 24.4 miles per day, you will need to pack approx 4 days of food, ~16,000 calories for this box.
