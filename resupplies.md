#Resupplies#
All resupply addresses are sourced from [HalfMile's PCT maps](https://www.pctmap.net/maps/). I used [UPS Priority Mail Regional Rate Box B2](https://store.usps.com/store/browse/uspsProductDetailMultiSkuDropDown.jsp?productId=P_RRB_B2) for each of the following resupply shipments as recommended to me by [JohnZ](http://johnzahorian.com/). It's a flat rate when shipping within the United States for up to 20lbs.

You will hike 148.4 miles from the start of Section H until your first resupply at White Pass.

**Important:** All calories listed are my own approximations based off of my height, weight, and daily mileage. I estimated about 4,000 calories per day, but yours will vary.

###1. White Pass (mi 2292.4)###
There is a small ski area 1/2 mile SW of the PCT on Hwy 12 with a motel and Kracker Barrel convenience store where you will ship your resupply box.
